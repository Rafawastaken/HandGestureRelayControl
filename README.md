**About Project**\n
The way this project works is that when the hand is open or closed sends a socket to esp8266 (esp-01) programmed as socket server that sets a GPIO High or Low accordingly to the socket conent.
The server side comunication of the esp, even though funcional is quite rudimentary because to me C programming language is still a struggle to me.
