# HandGestureRelayControl
##Control relay using hand gestures

This project is an adaptation of the Hand Gesture Module/Finger Counter projected created and taught by @murtazahassan at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY&t=12172s.

## About Project

The way this project works is that when the hand is open or closed it sends a socket to an esp8266 (esp-01) connected to the network coded as socket server that sets a GPIO High or Low accordingly to the socket conent.
The server side comunication of the esp, even though funcional is quite rudimentary becauseC programming language is a struggle to me, need to study more about it.
